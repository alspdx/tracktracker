# Epicodus Track tracktracker

#### A survey website to help prospective students pick an educational program at Epicodus, 2017.

#### by **Adam Smith**

## Description

This website was developed in order to gather information about the user and use that information to suggest a particular program at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/), a programming school. The user first enters a bit of information about themselves before the survey is displayed. The user then selects answers for a series of multiple-choice questions. After the survey is completed, the page will display a suggestion of which track they should choose if they plan to attend Epicodus. If the user enters a city other than Portland in their personal information, a section is displayed on the page with a link to local housing information.
